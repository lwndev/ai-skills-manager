# Implementation Plan: [Project Name]

## Overview
[1-2 paragraph summary of what's being built and why]

## Features Summary

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|------------|--------------|----------|------------|--------|
| FEAT-001   | [Name]       | High     | Low        | Pending |

## Recommended Build Sequence

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
**Feature:** [Feature Name]
**Status:** Pending

#### Rationale
- Why build this first
- What patterns it establishes
- Dependencies it creates/resolves

#### Implementation Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. ...

#### Deliverables
- [ ] File/component 1
- [ ] File/component 2

---

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
**Feature:** [Feature Name]
**Status:** Pending

#### Rationale
- Why this phase follows the previous
- What it builds upon

#### Implementation Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two

#### Deliverables
- [ ] File/component 1
- [ ] File/component 2
