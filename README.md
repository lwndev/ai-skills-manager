# AI Skills Manager

AI Skills Manager (ASM) enables team members to create, test, distribute, install, update, and remove skills. It will initially focus on the [Claude Code Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) system developed by Anthropic and may expand over time if more vendors support or develop their own skills systems.
