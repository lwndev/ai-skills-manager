# Chore: Fix ajv Moderate Vulnerability

## Chore ID

`CHORE-023`

## GitHub Issue

[#98](https://github.com/lwndev/ai-skills-manager/issues/98)

## Category

`dependencies`

## Description

Resolve the moderate-severity ajv ReDoS vulnerability (GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6) that CHORE-022 noted as "unfixable upstream." The ajv maintainers have since released v6.14.0 with a backported fix, allowing a simple `npm audit fix` to bump ajv from 6.12.6 to 6.14.0 within eslint's dependency tree.

## Affected Files

- `package-lock.json`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities (all severities)
- [x] `npm run quality` passes (lint + tests + coverage + audit)

## Completion

**Status:** `Completed`

**Completed:** 2026-02-27

**Pull Request:** [#PR](https://github.com/lwndev/ai-skills-manager/pull/PR)

## Notes

- Follows CHORE-021 ([#92](https://github.com/lwndev/ai-skills-manager/issues/92)) and CHORE-022 ([#96](https://github.com/lwndev/ai-skills-manager/issues/96)) which addressed earlier npm audit findings
- CHORE-022 documented this ajv finding as unfixable because ajv v6 had no patched release at the time; ajv 6.14.0 has since been published
- The fix is a lockfile-only change — no `package.json` overrides or library replacements needed
